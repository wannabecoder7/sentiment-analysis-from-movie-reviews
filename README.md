# sentiment-analysis-from-movie-reviews

**Overview**
This project focuses on sentiment analysis of movie reviews using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. Sentiment analysis is the task of automatically determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text, in this case, movie reviews. The goal is to classify the sentiment of the reviews into positive, negative, or neutral categories.

**Features**
**Preprocessing:** Text cleaning and tokenization.
**Vectorization:** Convert text data into numerical vectors using techniques like Bag-of-Words, TF-IDF, or word embeddings.
**Machine Learning Models:** Implementation of various algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Naive Bayes, LSTM, or Transformer models like BERT.
**Evaluation:** Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score for evaluating model performance.

The project utilizes the rotten tomato movie reviews dataset for training and testing the sentiment analysis models. This dataset consists of user-generated reviews and ratings for movies, making it suitable for sentiment analysis tasks.

**Requirements**
